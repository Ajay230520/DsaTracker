# DSA Practice Tracker

Welcome to the DSA Practice Tracker! This project aims to help individuals prepare for technical interviews at top-tier tech companies by providing a comprehensive platform to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions from various levels and platforms.

## Introduction
This web-based tracker was inspired by Striver's A2Z sheet, aiming to consolidate practice questions from platforms like Geeks for Geeks (GFG) and LeetCode. It offers a curated set of questions categorized by difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) to assist users in honing their problem-solving skills.

## Features
- **DSA Question Bank**: Access a wide range of DSA questions from GFG and LeetCode.
- **Categorized Difficulty Levels**: Questions are segregated into easy, medium, and hard categories.
- **Platform Flexibility**: Practice questions from multiple platforms within a single interface.
- **Progress Tracking**: Keep track of your solved and pending questions for better preparation.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily find specific questions using search filters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless navigation and usage.
